# 🌠 Meteorite Landings Prediction

This project predicts whether a meteorite was **“Fell”** or **“Found”** using a **Random Forest Classifier** and visualizes insights using **Power BI**.

---

## 📘 Overview
The project analyzes NASA’s Meteorite Landings dataset to understand the distribution and classification of meteorites across the globe.  
It combines **machine learning** and **data visualization** to derive actionable insights for research and education.

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed missing values, outliers, and irrelevant columns.  
2. **Feature Selection** – Selected key attributes like `mass`, `year`, `latitude`, and `longitude`.  
3. **Model Building** – Applied a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict “Fell” vs. “Found.”  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Used accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix for validation.  
5. **Visualization** – Created an interactive **Power BI dashboard** for exploration.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** R, DAX  
- **Libraries:** `tidyverse`, `caret`, `randomForest`, `ggplot2`  
- **Visualization:** Power BI  
- **Dataset:** [NASA Meteorite Landings]

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Meteorite classification depends heavily on **mass**, **year**, and **location**.
- Over 91% of recorded meteorites are categorized as **“Found.”**
- Temporal trends show spikes around **1960** and **2000s**.

---

## 📈 Dashboard
Interactive Power BI dashboard includes:
- Total meteorite mass over time  
- Meteorite falls vs. found distribution  
- Classification by type and average mass per class  

---

## 🧾 Reference
- NASA’s Meteorite Landings Dataset (Kaggle)  
- Academic papers on meteorite fall prediction (OUP, ResearchGate)
